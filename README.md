## Description

The `printf` repository is a collection of utility functions related to formatted output in C programming language. The primary function of this repository is to provide a custom implementation of the `printf` function, which allows users to format and print data to the standard output or other streams.

## Features

- Custom `printf` function: This repository includes a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C, offering a wide range of format specifiers similar to the standard `printf`.
- Format specifiers: Users can utilize various format specifiers such as `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, `%f`, etc., to format and display data conveniently.
- Stream support: The `printf` function supports printing to different streams like standard output, files, or user-defined streams.
- Extensible: Developers can easily extend the functionality by adding new custom format specifiers tailored to their specific needs.
- Lightweight and efficient: The code is designed to be lightweight and optimized for efficiency, ensuring minimal performance overhead.

## Installation

To use the `printf` library in your C projects first ensure you are bright, then follow these steps:

1. Clone the `printf` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/printf.git
```

2. Include the `printf.h` header file in your C code:

```c
#include "path/to/printf.h"
```

3. Compile your C code with the `printf.c` source file:

```bash
gcc -o your_program your_program.c path/to/printf.c
```

4. Run your compiled program:

```bash
./your_program
```
If you don't feel bright today, try reading 1000 pages of a boo about C first.

## Usage

The `printf` function in this repository follows a format similar to the standard `printf`. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "path/to/printf.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    printf("The answer is %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}
```

For more detailed information on format specifiers and usage examples, refer to the [wiki](link-to-wiki) section.
